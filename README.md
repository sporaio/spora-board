# Spora

This is Spora main repository.

## What is Spora?

Spora is the first coin-sized programmable board ready to use and completely open source. It is equipped an accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope and environmental temperature sensors. All packed in a coin-shaped board, 18mm (0.724 in) of diameter, with a powerfull MCU and Bluetooth module to transmit the collected data.

It is completely functional and it is ready to use. Its small size makes it ideal for developing a true prototype, closer to your final product with which you can experiment as much as you want before going to the production line.

Combine multiple Spora and let them communicate, to build a full-body wearable to do whatever you want.

## Make it your own

In this repository you'll find all you need to build your own Spora board. Expand it, change it, make it your own.

## Expandable Board

Spora can be programmed and expanded to anything you need. Fitness, sports, motion capture... anything can be achieved with Spora. And to do so we have developed a programmer expansion that is also open source and can be found in this repository: https://github.com/sporaio/spora-programmer-expansion
